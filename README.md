SMC-RNA Challenge Entry: tnv-8295762
========================================================

This is a CWL workflow which was submitted to the [SMC-RNA Challenge][smcrna] in the fusion detection category.

Example and reference data files are stored on [Synapse][data] and are
defined in synapse_inputs.json.  
A Synapse user account is required to access data from Synapse.

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/smc-rna-challenge/tnv-8295762
cd tnv-8295762

# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download the test data to ./data
# You'll need a synapse.org account.
python download.py

# Run the workflow
cwltool main.cwl
```

Resource Usage
--------------------------------------------------------

Most SMC-RNA entries were tested on machines with 16 vCPUs and 60 GB of RAM.
Many entries did not use the full amount of resources.
Some required more memory and were allowed 104 GB of RAM.


Docker images
--------------------------------------------------------

Details
========================================================

Challenge participants were asked to complete a quiz to describe some of the
details about their entry:



#### What methods does the tool use?
Read-pair analysis



#### What alignment algorithms does the tool use?
N/A











































#### Is your method alignment independent?
No









#### We are developing a new DREAM Challenge on visualization of transcript isoforms and gene fusions. This visualization challenge is a companion to the currently running 2016 DREAM SMC-RNA (somatic mutation calling-RNA) Challenge that you are participating in. Please find more information here - http://biovis.net/2016/dream/. Do note that the content of this site will continue to evolve. Would you like to share your results from this challenge with the SMC-RNA BioVis Data Visualization DREAM Challenge?
No
